## What is this?

At EQ Works, we take a more effective path to the technical interview. Instead of solving abstract algorithms and data structure problems, you'll get to work on one or more take-home work samples that resemble our actual work. If you are a maker, you will find the problems easier (perhaps more enjoyable) yet much more meaningful to understand how well you can integrate into our team from a technical perspective. We encourage you to check out [our hiring philosophy](https://github.com/EQWorks/common/blob/main/hiring.md) to get more insights.

If you are interested in working with us but haven't applied yet, please go to https://eqworks.workable.com/ and check out the roles.

Once you apply, you will receive an email containing problems you may solve using one or more of the work samples provided below.
