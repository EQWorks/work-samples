## What is this?

At EQ Works, we take a more effective path to technical interview -- you get to work on some problems based on one or more work samples that resemble our actual technical stack. If you are a real maker, you will find the problems way easier (maybe more enjoyable) than algorithm questions like "how to implement bubble sort?", yet much more meaningful for us to understand how well you can integrate into our team from a technical perspective.

If you are interested to work with us, but haven't already applied, go to https://eqworks.workable.com/ and apply for *only one* primary role that you're interested in.

You will then receive an email containing problems which you may solve using one of the work samples in this repository. We don't have a fixed deadline so work on your own pace, but it's recommended to submit your problem solutions within a week from the day you receive the problems.

## Roles

### Backend

You will solve problems using the [`backend-go`](backend-go/src/counter) work sample. The work sample resembles our backend setup. [Golang](https://golang.org/) is our choice to implement performance critical services and applications.

### Frontend and Design

You will receive problems that cover both server-side and client-side design aspects. You have the choice to do both or focus on one.

For the *server-side* aspect, you will solve problems using one of [`api-python`](api-python) or [`api-node`](api-node) work samples.

For the *client-side design* aspect, you may consume a [hosted version](https://eq-work-samples-api.herokuapp.com) of the same API provided as the `api-python` work sample, but you can benefit more from running your own copy, as you can adjust the server-side implementation as you wish. Since you should already know about Javascript, the `api-node` work sample is highly recommended. For client-side implementations, feel free to pick anything that you are comfortable with. However, if you don't have a preference, we recommend using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).
