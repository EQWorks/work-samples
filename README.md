## What is this?

At EQ Works, we take a more effective path to technical interview -- you get to work on some problems based on one or more work samples that resemble our actual technical stack. If you are a real maker, you will find the problems way easier (maybe more enjoyable) than algorithm questions like "how to implement bubble sort?", yet much more meaningful for us to understand how well you can integrate into our team from a technical perspective.

If you are interested to work with us, but haven't already applied, go to https://eqworks.workable.com/ and apply for *only one* primary role that you're interested in.

You will then receive an email containing problems which you may solve using one or more of the work samples provided below.
