## What is this?

At EQ Works, we take a more effective path to technical interview -- instead of answering whiteboard questions like "how to implement bubble sort?", or "what's the difference between an interface and an abstract class? when to use which?", or something equivalent to "cite me what HTTP/1.1 (rfc2616) is", you get to work on some problems based on one or more work samples that resemble our actual technical stack. If you are a maker, you will find the problems way easier (maybe more enjoyable) yet much more meaningful for us to understand how well you can integrate into our team from a technical perspective.

If you are interested to work with us, but haven't already applied, go to https://eqworks.workable.com/ and apply for *only one* primary role. Don't worry about spending too much time tailoring your resume, and we strongly recommend that you don't waste time on a cover letter -- in code, we trust.

You will then receive an email containing problems which you may solve using one or more of the work samples provided below.
