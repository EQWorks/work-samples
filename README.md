## What is this?

At EQ Works, we take a more effective path to the technical interview. Instead of solving algorithms and data structure problems on the spot, you'll get to work on one or more take-home work samples that resemble our actual work. If you are a maker, you will find the problems easier (perhaps more enjoyable) yet much more meaningful for us to understand how well you can integrate into our team from a technical perspective.

If you are interested to work with us, go to https://eqworks.workable.com/ and check out the roles.

Once you apply, you will receive an email containing problems which you may solve using one or more of the work samples provided below.
